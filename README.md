# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Some improvements could include the addition of a link to the about section in the nav bar, more detail in the brief about flat BEM, and more detail about the menu structure and certain CSS styles that would be helpful for creating it (suggestions that may or may not work but help visualize what is neccessary to create that type of design).
